<p>We probably don’t need to convince you that electricity is useful, but
perhaps it would be helpful to spend some time thinking about why you,
as a future Air or Space Force officer, care about how electricity is
generated, how it flows in certain systems, and why you should care
about things like resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers,
AC-to-DC converters, and all the other devices we will discuss in this
course. The most obvious example is an aircraft. Modern aircraft and
spacecraft rely heavily on electronics for control, stability,
avionics, navigation, guidance, and comfort. However, each of those
devices has their own power requirements, and designing the system is
a complex undertaking. As an Air or Space Force officer, it is
critical to understand why your cockpit or control station looks the
way it does and why the aircraft or spacecraft was built the way it
was. Furthermore, in a pinch, you’ll have to do some on-the-fly load
balancing, and this course will help you understand what you’re doing
as you flip those switches.</p>

<div align="center">Figure 1: 787 Electrical System Overview (Source: Boeing)</div>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Figure 1 shows part of the electrical system of a Boeing 787
Dreamliner, and it is typical of many different aircraft. Starting
from the top, we see generators connected to each engine. On some
level, it makes sense that you could connect some kind of device to an
engine to extract electrical power from it. But, how does that
actually work? Is that a perfectly efficient process? What is the
difference between the type of power produced by a generator
(Alternating Current) and the type of power required by most of the
electronics on the aircraft (Direct Current)? The lessons on Engines,
Generators, and AC-to-DC conversion will hit on these key topics.</p>
<p>Moving down, we see several different voltage levels – how do we
design the system such that the right voltage level and type gets to
the right electronics? Furthermore, how do we protect those
electronics from drawing too much power? The Power I and II lessons
will describe how this happens and discuss all the considerations of
designing a power distribution system.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to the loads (i.e., what’s using the power) –
how do we interpret quantities like voltage, current, and power? How
can we model these loads in a meaningful way and, furthermore, how
does the way in which we connect these loads affect the system as a
whole? These are all things we’ll discuss in the Introduction to
Circuits lessons.</p>

<h2>Electric Charges and Voltage<a class="headerlink" href="#electric-charges-and-voltage" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Hopefully, you already know what would
happen if you connected a 9-Volt (V) battery to a simple light bulb.
As long as the battery was sufficiently charged and the wires
connected correctly, you would probably expect electrons to flow from
the battery and through the filament inside the bulb, causing the bulb
itself to glow.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image2.png" /></p>
<div align="center">Figure 2: 9-Volt (V) battery connected to a simple light bulb</div>
<p>If we were interested in the chemistry or physics involved, we could
discuss how the various metals inside the battery cause the electrons
to flow or why the flowing electrons cause the filament to glow. We
could even measure the brightness of the light and describe it using
some unit of illumination. While these things are interesting, we will
focus on applications of these principles in this course.</p>
<p>To understand what’s going on in our light bulb circuit—or anything
else in the exciting world of electrical engineering—we need to
briefly discuss electric charges.</p>
<p>You probably already know electrons have a negative charge (-) and
protons have a positive charge (+). Accordingly, any atom or molecule
with <em>more electrons</em> than protons would have a negative charge while
any atom or molecule with <em>more protons</em> than electrons would have a
positive charge.</p>
<p>We refer to the flow of these charged particles through a conductive
medium, such as a wire, as current. It takes work (or energy) to
separate electrons from atoms, and once these electrons have been
separated from their atoms, they flow through conductive media,
thereby producing current. When we use electricity to do something,
such as turning on a light bulb or heating up our food in a microwave,
we are really just getting this energy back in a different form.</p>
<p>To describe how electricity can be used to do work, let’s start by
taking a single negative charge and placing it near a single positive
charge:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image3.png" /></p>
<p>Because the charges are opposite, they will attract, meaning there
will be a measurable force that pulls the two charges towards each
other.</p>
<p><em>Voltage</em>, which is one of the fundamental concepts in electrical
engineering, is simply a way to describe this force between the
opposite charges.</p>
<p>To explain what we mean by this, let’s
say the negative charge is actually an electron and the positive
charge is some positive ion that is fixed in place. Let’s also say we
want the electron to move from point A to point B:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image4.png" /></p>
<p>Like everything else in the world, an electron doesn’t move unless
some energy (or work) is expended to make it move. Fortunately, in
this case, we don’t have to expend energy to make the electron move
because there is already another force, known as the electromagnetic
force, that will expend the energy for us. As we said earlier,
opposite charges attract, and this attraction is due to the
electromagnetic force between the positive and negative charges. This
attraction is will expend energy to move the electron from point A to
point B. This may seem like free energy, but this is just how the
electromagnetic force works! If we carefully measured the amount of
work (or energy) expended by the electromagnetic force to move the
electron from point A to point B and divided this amount by the charge
of the electron being moved, we would get the voltage required to move
the electron from point A to B.</p>
<p>Mathematically, we can express this definition for voltage as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[V = \ \frac{dw}{dq}\]</div>
<p>In other words, voltage is the amount of work required (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dw\)</span>) per unit
of charge (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dq\)</span>) to move a charge from one point to another.</p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<p>As it turns out, the way electricity
flows is very similar to the way water flows from the water tower to
your house. Consider what happens when you connect a hose to a water
faucet. When you turn the faucet on, the water pressure from the pipes
in your house pushes water through the hose. That pressure comes from
the water tower – which uses the gravitational potential energy
created by holding the water hundreds of feet above the ground to
generate a city’s water pressure. For this analogy, we can think of
the water tower as the voltage in a circuit because, much like how the
water tower’s potential energy creates water pressure, the voltage
represents an electric potential that creates “pressure” for electrons
to move. Just as a taller water tower has a higher gravitational
potential energy and can create more water pressure, a larger voltage
level has a higher electric potential and can create more “pressure”
for electrons to move. Figure 3 demonstrates this analogy.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image5.jpeg" /></p>
<div align="center">Figure 3: An analogy relating voltage to the height of a water tower</div>
<p>When you hook some wires up to a battery, the voltage “pressure”
causes electrons to flow through the wire (as long as the path makes a
complete circuit back to the other battery terminal).</p>
<p>We measure this “pressure” with the unit volts. As you might expect,
the more volts we have, the higher the “pressure”. A 9-V battery has
twice the “pressure” of a 4.5-V battery and, therefore, causes twice
as many electrons to pass through our light bulb each second, making
it brighter.</p>
<p>Before we move on and talk about current, we need to stress two things
about voltage: voltage is always measured between two points and
exists even if nothing is flowing.</p>
<p>First, <strong>voltage is always measured between two points</strong>. For this
reason, we often talk about the voltage across a device. The voltage
across our light bulb, for instance, tells us how much work is
actually being done (per unit charge) to move electrons from one end
of the filament to the other. From our water analogy, we reference the
potential of the water with respect to its height above ground. In
electrical engineering, we usually measure voltage with respect to the
zero voltage point (conveniently called “ground”).</p>
<p>Second, <strong>voltage exists even if nothing is flowing</strong>. This is a
subtle, but important point. Voltage doesn’t measure the movement of
electrons, but rather, the pressure that causes (or would cause)
electrons to move. Put simply, voltage has the “potential” to move
electrons if we choose connect wires to the device providing the
voltage. For this reason, voltage is sometimes referred to as electric
potential. Our water analogy holds here as well. If we were to close
the pipes leading to someone’s house, no water would flow into the
house, but there would still be water pressure in the pipes leading to
the house. Likewise, a battery has voltage, even if it is not
connected and no current is flowing.</p>

<h2>Current, Power, and Resistance<a class="headerlink" href="#current-power-and-resistance" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We know that voltage applies a “pressure” to move electrons, and once
we hook a device that supplies a voltage, such as a battery, up to a
circuit, electrons begin to flow through the wires. This flow of
electrons is known as <em>current</em>, and current tells us how many
electrons actually move when a voltage is applied to a circuit. More
specifically, current tells us how many electrons move in a set period
of time. Mathematically, we use the letter <em>I</em> to represent current,
which is defined by the equation</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[I = \ \frac{dq}{dt}\]</div>
<p>In words, current measures the amount of charge (dq) that passes
through a specific point in a given amount of time (dt).</p>
<p>If you think of current as measuring how
many electrons flow per second, you have the right idea. The unit of
current is the ampere (often shortened to amp) and is abbreviated as
“A”. The more amps you have, the more electrons that flow. As you
might expect, a current of 9 A has three times as many flowing
electrons as a current of 3 A.</p>
<p>In keeping with our water analogy, we can imagine placing a water flow
meter in the middle of the pipe at the bottom of a water tower. This
meter would tell us how many “water molecules” went by over a given
time. This is the same as how we measure electrical current.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image7.jpeg" /></p>
<div align="center">Figure 4: Current in water flow</div>
<p>This brings us to a key point: <strong>current is always measured through a
single point</strong>. Therefore, if we say that the current through a light
bulb is 2 A, what we really mean is that the current through any point
in the light bulb’s filament is 2 A. There are many things that can
affect how much current flows through a wire, and we will explore
these things later on in this lesson and in future lessons.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image8.png" /></p>
<p>When men like Benjamin Franklin were trying to make sense of
electricity, they defined current in a way that is a bit confusing,
and that definition has stuck to this day. When we connect a battery
to a light bulb, we say that the current flows from the positive
terminal (+), through the bulb, and then back to the negative terminal
(-).</p>
<p>The arrow in Figure 5 shows the direction of current flow in accordance
with our definition. However, something is wrong with this. We know
that current is the flow of electrons, and we know that electrons
have a negative charge. Wouldn’t a negatively charged electron
be attracted to the positive terminalrather than repelled by it?
If this is what you were thinking, then you are exactly right.
When we connect a battery to a light bulb, what really happens is
that the electrons leave the negative terminal (-), flow through
the light bulb, and then return to the positive terminal (+).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image9.png" /></p>
<div align="center">Figure 5: Current flowing from a 9 V battery into a simple light bulb</div>
<p>This can get really confusing, but the good news is that it really
doesn’t matter. We just say that the current flows in one direction
when the electrons actually flow in the opposite direction. If you
simply follow the convention that <strong>current flows from positive to
negative</strong> (or higher voltage to lower voltage), you’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>Power and Resistance</strong></p>
<p>Voltage and current are fundamental to ECE, but there is much more to
ECE than just understanding this relationship.</p>
<p>Think back to our water hose analogy. It’s nice that we have lots of
water pressure in our pipes, but if we never turn on the faucet,
nothing would ever get done. Likewise, we could open the faucet to let
water flow through the hose, but if we don’t do something with the
water, then the water is wasted.</p>
<p>It’s all about doing. We take a shower. We wash the car. We fill up a
water balloon.</p>
<p>In the electrical world, we use the term <em>power</em> to measure the work
that gets done per unit time. We light up a room. We toast some bread.
We use a computer. All of these require power, which is defined by the
equation</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P = \ \frac{dw}{dt}\]</div>
<p>In terms of our light bulb, power is the energy consumed (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dw\)</span>) by the
bulb in a given amount of time (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt\)</span>). Since energy and work use the
same units, we can also say that power measures the work that is done
in a given amount of time.</p>
<p>The unit of power is the watt (W), which is equivalent to joules per
second. Therefore, a 100-W light bulb consumes 100 joules of energy
per second. A 50-W bulb consumes 50 joules per second.</p>
<p>So what do current and voltage have to do with power? The short answer
is everything. To explain, let’s review the definitions for both
current and voltage:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[I = \ \frac{dq}{dt}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ V = \ \frac{dw}{dq}\]</div>
<p>Notice what happens when we multiply these together:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[IV = \ \left( \frac{dq}{dt} \right)\left( \frac{dw}{dq} \right) = \frac{dw}{dt} = P\]</div>
<p>In other words,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P\  = \ IV\]</div>
<p>Power is equal to current times voltage. This equation is called the
<em>Power Equation</em> and is very useful. You will use this equation in ECE
and throughout your life.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Example Problem:</strong> The filament of a
light bulb has 9 V placed across it, which causes 90 mA to flow
through it. How much power does the bulb consume?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image10.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Understand:</strong> The power consumed by a light bulb depends on the
current through it and the voltage across it.</p>
<p><strong>Identify:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Knowns</strong>: 9V of potential is lost (dropped) across the bulb and
90mA of current is flowing through it</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unknowns:</strong> Power consumed by the bulb</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> None.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plan:</strong> Since we know both the current through the filament and the
voltage across it, we can use the Power Equation to find the power:</p>
<div align="center">P = IV</div>
<p><strong>Solve:</strong></p>
<div align="center">P = IV = (90 mA)(9 V) = 810 mW</div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The light bulb consumes 810 mW of power.</p>
<p>This example problem illustrates the notion that power is the product
of current and voltage, but it doesn’t quite explain what’s actually
going on in the circuit. The scenario implies we can control both the
current through and the voltage across the light bulb, which isn’t the
case. In simple circuits like these, we can control the current or the
voltage, but not both.</p>
<p>The key to understanding what is really going on is the concept of
<em>resistance</em>. The filament of a light bulb is designed to resist the
flow of electrons in order to generate heat, which causes the filament
to glow white-hot, thereby emitting light. This is because, as
electrons flow through the filament, they bounce off of atoms in the
filament and lose energy. When enough energy is lost to the filament,
it heats up and eventually glows. Mathematically, we use <em>R</em> for
resistance, which is defined by the equation</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[R = \ \frac{V}{I}\ \]</div>
<p>This equation is known as <em>Ohm’s Law</em>, which is more commonly written
as,</p>
<div align="center">𝑉 = 𝐼𝑅</div>
<p>We measure resistance using ohms (Ω). A device that has 200 Ω resists
the flow of electricity twice as much as a 100 Ω device.</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>Think about our water tower and the pipes that carry the water to your
house. As with most faucets, we can control the flow of water
depending on how much we open the outlet valve. In other words, we
decrease the resistance to the flow of water (current) by making the
opening bigger, which allows more water to flow. When we start to
close the valve, we increase the resistance by causing the opening to
get smaller and, therefore, less water flows.</p>
<p>One important point about Ohm’s Law is that <strong>it only works with
devices that can be modeled as resistors</strong>. Later on, when we start
dealing with transformers and other non-resistive devices, we will
have to use other tools to solve for voltages and currents.</p>
<p><strong>Example Problem 1:</strong> The filament of a light bulb has a resistance
of 100 Ω. If 9 V are placed across it, how much power does the bulb
consume?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Block1/L01/ECE215_L01_media/image17.png" />
R = 100 Ω</p>
<p><strong>Understand:</strong> We want to find out how much power (energy per second)
the bulb consumes.</p>
<p><strong>Identify:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Knowns</strong>: 9V of potential is lost (dropped) across the bulb, the
resistance of the bulb is 100 Ω</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unknowns:</strong> Power consumed by the bulb, current flow through the
bulb</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> None.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plan:</strong> We want to solve for the power using the power equation, 𝑃 =
𝐼𝑉</p>
<p>However, we must first find the current using Ohm’s Law,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I = \ \frac{V}{R}\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Solve:</strong> First, we will solve for the current.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[I = \ \frac{V}{R} = \ \frac{9V}{100\mathrm{\Omega}} = 90\ mA\]</div>
<p>Then, we can use the current we found to solve for the power consumed.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ P = \ IV\  = \ (90mA)(9V)\  = \ 810mW\]</div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The light bulb consumes 810 mW of power.</p>

<h2>Basic Electrical Devices and Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-electrical-devices-and-examples" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Hopefully, you now understand what happens when we connect a battery
to a light bulb – the battery provides a voltage “pressure” that
causes electrons to flow. The filament resists the flow, which
determines the actual current. The voltage and current determine the
power consumed by the bulb.</p>
<p>Now we have to figure out how to predict what will happen when we
start changing things. To do this, we’re going to change how we model
the devices in our circuit.</p>
<p>First, we’ll model the voltage source
with the following symbol:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image11.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Notice the positive (+) and negative (-) terminals on the voltage
source. As you might expect, the “pressure” at the positive terminal
is higher than the “pressure” at the negative one. Therefore, the
current flows out of the positive terminal and returns to the
negative.</p>
<p>We will model the light bulb as a
resistor. Exactly as the name implies, a resistor is a device that
resists the flow of electricity. As with the previous example problem,
we’ll assume the light bulb has a resistance of 100 Ω.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image12.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Using these devices, we can redraw our battery and light bulb as the
circuit below. We added some arrows with labels to show the currents
coming out of the voltage source and passing through the resistor. We
also labeled the voltage across the resistor, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span><sub>R</sub>, and the current
through the resistor, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span><sub>R</sub>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image13.png" /></p>
<p>Notice the polarity (where we put the + and -) of the resistor. As
with the voltage source, we label the side with the greater pressure
as positive (+) and the side with the lower pressure as negative (-).</p>
<p>Also, notice the relationship between the polarity of the devices and
the current flow. In the voltage source, current comes out of the
positive terminal, but in the resistor, current flows into the
positive terminal.</p>
<p>If this isn’t making sense, think about the voltage source as a water
pump pushing water through the circuit. The resistor, then, represents
everything that tries to slow the water down. The arrows represent the
direction of water flow. The polarity labels (+ and -) represent
relative pressure. The pressure is always higher coming out of a pump
than going into it. Likewise, the pressure is always higher going into
a resistor than coming out of it.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that when we draw circuits, we are just
creating models of real devices. We model an electrical device for
what it does, rather than what it is. What a 9-V battery does is
provide 9 volts, therefore we model it as a 9 V power source.</p>
<p>This allows us to replace the battery with anything that provides 9 V
without changing what happens to the circuit. For example, we could
use multiple smaller batteries or a device called an AC-DC converter
(more on this in Block II) to produce a 9-V output, and it wouldn’t
matter. The current and power would be the same.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we also lose something whenever we create models.
Because of cost or weight or convenience constraints, it might
actually matter what kind of power source we use. These issues are
lost in the circuit model and need to be tracked separately.</p>
<p>Additionally, the model doesn’t fully represent what happens in a real
circuit. First of all, there are inherent errors associated with real
devices. A real 100 Ω resistor, for example, might have an actual
resistance of 96.7 Ω. Likewise, even if a 9-V battery actually
provided 9 volts, it would not do so forever. Over time, a battery
will lose energy and the voltage will drop, if only slightly.</p>
<p>For much of electrical engineering, modeling circuits using <em>ideal
devices</em> helps to simplify the analysis so that we can solve a given
problem more quickly. The term ideal implies zero error and 100%
efficiency. Although there is always error, the error when modeling
ideal devices is usually small enough to have negligible impacts on
our final answer. In this course, we will mostly use ideal devices in
our analyses.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, you now have all the tools you need to predict what
will happen to a wide variety circuits consisting of one voltage
source and one light bulb.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Example Problem 2:</strong> A light bulb with a resistance of 200 Ω is
connected to a 3-V battery, as modeled in the circuit below. If the
wiring in the flashlight is limited to 20 mA, will the flashlight
function as designed?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image14.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Understand:</strong> The light bulb is drawing current but is limited by
how much current the wiring can support.</p>
<p><strong>Identify:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Knowns</strong>: The light bulb is connected to a 3V voltage source and
has a resistance of 200 Ω</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unknowns:</strong> Current flow through the bulb</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> The light bulb can be modeled as a resistor and is
using all 3V. All the current flowing through the bulb is flowing
through the wiring.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plan:</strong> If the actual current is 20.00 mA or less, the flashlight
will work. If it is greater than 20 mA, the wire will burn up, ruining
the flashlight. So, we will find the current through the bulb using
Ohm’s Law (V=IR).</p>
<p><strong>Solve:</strong> The current drawn by the light bulb is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[I = \ \frac{V}{R} = \ \frac{3V}{200\mathrm{\Omega}} = 0.015\ A = 15\ mA\]</div>
<p>Therefore the current through the bulb (modeled as a resistor) is 15
mA.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, the flashlight will work as designed since the
current in the circuit is only 15 mA, which is less than the 20 mA
limit.</p>
<p><strong>Example Problem 3:</strong> Two competing flashlight designs are modeled
below. If the sole measure of merit is to </ins>minimize power
consumption</ins>, which of the two is the better design?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image15.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Understand:</strong> This problem is very similar to previous problems, but
now requires us to find the power consumed by two different flashlight
designs.</p>
<p><strong>Identify:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Knowns</strong>: We know the voltage supplied by each source and the
resistance of each bulb.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unknowns:</strong> Power consumed by each bulb.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> The light bulbs can be modeled as a resistor and
are using all the voltage (potential) provided by the source. Since
power consumption is our sole measure of merit, then the option with
the lesser power consumption will be the better option.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plan:</strong> We could calculate the current through each bulb, and then
the power, but there is a quicker way. If we substitute Ohm’s Law into
the Power Equation, we can arrive at an equation that solves for power
in terms of only voltage and resistance.</p>
<p>First, we start with both the Power Equation and Ohm’s Law.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ P = IV; V = IR \]</div>
<p>Next, we solve Ohm’s Law for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> to get:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ I = \ \frac{V}{R} \]</div>
<p>Then, we can substitute this into the Power Equation:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P = IV = \ \left( \frac{V}{R} \right)*V = \frac{V^{2}}{R}\]</div>
<p>Finally, we can compare the power consumption of the two options.</p>
<p><strong>Solve:</strong> Let’s first solve for the power consumed by Option A:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P = \frac{V^{2}}{R} = \frac{(9V)^{2}}{90\mathrm{\Omega}} = 0.9W = 900\ mW\]</div>
<p>Now, solving for the power consumed by Option B:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P = \frac{V^{2}}{R} = \frac{(6V)^{2}}{50\mathrm{\Omega}} = 0.720W = 720\ mW\]</div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Option B is the better design because it consumes 720 mW,
which is less than the 900 mW consumed by Option A.</p>
<p>For simple problems like the one we just solved, the decision is
obvious as soon as the comparison is made. However, in engineering
(and many other pursuits), it is not enough to reach the right
decision. We must also adequately articulate the decision so that
others can understand it and act accordingly. Therefore, our answer is
<strong>not</strong> “<em>Option B</em>,” but rather “<em>Option B is the better design
because it consumes 720 mW, which is less than the 900 mW consumed by
Option A</em>.” Communication is very important in all aspects of life,
especially engineering.</p>
