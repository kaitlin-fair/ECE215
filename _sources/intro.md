# Welcome to ECE215 / ECE215S!

ECE215 and ECE215S share the same title, _Principles of Electronic Cyber Warfare_, and cover the same foundational concepts. These courses will therefore be taught on a similar schedule utilizing the same course readings, slides, and practice problems that you will find on this website. 

Some of these files will be updated throughout the semester. It's recommended you download files just prior to the lecture for which the material pertains.
