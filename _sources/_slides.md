# Slides

Here you will find the slides used for both ECE215 and ECE215S. These files will be updated throughout the semester and posted as we go. It's recommended you download files just prior to the lecture for which the material pertains.

If the slides are different for ECE215 and ECE215S, you will see two files for that lecture. Otherwise, just download the single lecture file.
