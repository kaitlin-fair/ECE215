<h2>Communications Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#communications-introduction" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Today, communication affects our lives in so many different ways. Given
the ubiquity of smart phones and other connected devices, we can
communicate with anyone at any given time. In the civilian world, we can
request an Uber, buy tickets to a Denver Broncos game, or have
near-instantaneous communication with someone across the country. In
military operations, communication is even more important, as it
provides critical information across the battlefield in near-real time.
Delivering information using electromagnetic signals from one location
to another requires some form of pathway or medium. These pathways can
be broadly categorized as either wired (such as a transmission line) or
wireless. We call these pathways <em>communication media</em>. Some people
refer to them as communications channels, so you may hear these two
terms used synonymously. In this lesson, we will first talk about four
different communication media, to include wireless, and then discuss
four types of wireless radio frequency (RF) propagation methods.</p>
<p>Before discussing communication media, we need to define some common
terminology. Every sinusoidal signal has a wavelength, or the distance
between two successive crests or troughs in the wave. In communications
systems, this distance is typically measured in meters. Wavelength and
frequency relate to each other using the following equation:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\lambda = \ \frac{c}{f}\]</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>λ (lambda) is the wavelength of the signal propagated</p>
<p>c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8^ <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{m}{s}\)</span>)</p>
<p>f is the frequency of the signal being propagated.</p>
<p>The relationship above shows that the wavelength of a signal gets larger
as the frequency gets smaller. Understanding this relationship is
critical as we go forward through this block, as communication media and
antennas depend on the frequency of the signal being transmitted.</p>

<h3>Transmission Lines<a class="headerlink" href="#transmission-lines" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The principles governing <em>transmission line</em> behavior of were covered in
Block 1. Recall, over long distances, transmission lines had an
intrinsic impedance that reduced the efficiency of power transmission.
Additionally, transmission lines can only support a limited range of
frequencies. Specially designed lines (e.g., coaxial or Ethernet cables)
can transmit signals up to a few hundred MHz, but above those
frequencies wired transmission lines act like low pass filters.</p>
<p>Despite these drawbacks, transmission lines do have some advantages: 1)
they are very reliable, 2) they are easy to repair, and 3) they are
relatively secure.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="waveguides">
<h2>Waveguides<a class="headerlink" href="#waveguides" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A <em>waveguide</em> is simply a hollow pipe through which an electromagnetic
signal is sent. The internal surfaces of a waveguide are highly
reflective allowing for very efficient transmission of the signal. Many
waveguides are rectangular in shape, although some are circular. Some
microwave ovens use waveguides to convey the energy from the magnetron,
which creates the signal, to the cooking chamber. In satellite dishes,
waveguides are used to connect the transmitter to the antenna.</p>
<p>The internal dimensions and shape of the waveguide determine which
frequencies can be transmitted through it. If the wavelength is too
large, the signal will not propagate in the waveguide. For example, high
frequency signals have short wavelengths, so they propagate well through
a waveguide; however, lower frequencies are blocked because of their
long wavelengths. As such, a waveguide acts as a high pass filter. The
cutoff frequency of a waveguide can be found using the equation:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[f_{c/o} = \ \frac{c}{2a}\]</div>
<p>In this equation, <em>c</em> is the speed of light and <em>a</em> is the length of the
longest side of the waveguide as shown here:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image513.png" /></p>
<p>The primary advantage of waveguides is very low attenuation, which is to
say the signal does not lose much power as it moves through the
waveguide. Disadvantages of waveguides include being heavy, rigid,
fairly difficult to repair, and expensive.</p>
<section id="example-problem-1">
<h3>Example Problem 1<a class="headerlink" href="#example-problem-1" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A freeway underpass is 8 m tall and 18 m wide. If
the underpass acts as a waveguide, will a signal from an AM radio
station be able to pass through?</p>
<p><strong>Understand</strong>: Next time you’re driving, tune to an AM station before
driving under an underpass and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>Identify Key Information</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Knowns:</strong> We know the dimensions of the underpass.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unknowns:</strong> The cutoff frequency of the “waveguide”, which is the
freeway.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> AM radio stations transmit near 1 MHz.
Additionally, we assume the underpass acts like a waveguide.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plan</strong>: Since the freeway underpass acts like a high pass filter, we
can use the waveguide equation to find the cutoff frequency and then
compare that frequency with the frequency of an AM radio station.</p>
<p><strong>Solve:</strong> The waveguide equation is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[f_{C} = \ \frac{c}{2a}\  = \ \ \frac{3*\ 10^{8}\ m/s}{2*(18\ m)}\  = 8.33\ MHz\]</div>
<p>Since the cutoff frequency of the underpass “waveguide” is above that of
the typical AM radio station, the underpass should prevent any
frequencies below 8.33 MHz from passing. Therefore, AM stations will be
blocked. FM stations, on the other hand, transmit near 100 MHz, and the
FM signals can be received under the same underpass.</p>

</section>
<section id="optical-fibers">
<h2>Optical Fibers<a class="headerlink" href="#optical-fibers" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><em>Optical fibers</em> act like waveguides for beams of light, which are very
high frequency signals. The light signal itself is most often a laser
beam, modulated by the information that is being sent. When transmitting
light in an optical fiber, the light beam bounces off the sides of the
glass fiber as it travels at the speed of light. Optical fibers allow
for very large bandwidths, and even allow multiple signals (different
“colors” of light) to be transmitted on the same fiber. Additionally,
the fibers are flexible and are relatively inexpensive (especially when
considering cost per bandwidth). Finally, optical fibers have relatively
low loss per unit distance.</p>
<p>The primary disadvantage of optical fibers is that they are very
difficult to install and repair. Fibers must be entirely replaced, or
spliced using complex equipment. Splicing optical fibers results in the
introduction of additional loss into the fiber. For example, the F-22
uses optical fiber to implement its “fly-by-light” system, but
maintaining the cabling can be a nightmare for the crews, especially
when donned in CBRNE gear.</p>

<section id="wireless">
<h2>Wireless<a class="headerlink" href="#wireless" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><em>Wireless</em> communications use the electromagnetic spectrum to transmit
and receive information without the use of wires, waveguides, or other
conductors. Typically, a wireless signal is transmitted from an antenna,
then it travels through free space until it is acquired by the receiving
antenna. This is exactly what happens every time you use your cell
phone. Even though radio frequencies and antennas are commonly
associated with wireless communications, laser beams can also be used to
communicate. A great example of this is the Lunar Laser Communications
Demonstration (LLCD) developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory. The LLCD used
lasers to successfully transmit at a data rate of 622 Mbps from lunar
orbit to Earth!</p>
<p>The primary advantages of using wireless communications are flexibility
and cost. Wireless communications can be used virtually anywhere, as
long as the transmitter and receiver have the required equipment. There
is no need to install or repair wires over long distances, so they are
relatively cheap to use and maintain.</p>
<p>The primary disadvantages of wireless communications are that they have
limited bandwidth and are not as reliable as the other communications
media. As we discussed earlier in this class, the radio frequency
spectrum in the United States is full, meaning there is no more
bandwidth available at radio frequencies for wireless communications.
Additionally, wireless communications are not as reliable as the other
communications media. For example, satellite TV, which uses wireless
communications, can lose service during severe storms whereas cable TV,
a transmission line, does not. Despite these disadvantages, wireless
communications are widely used in today’s world, and for that reason,
various wireless communications will be the focus of the rest of this
block.</p>
<section id="wireless-communications">
<h3>Wireless Communications<a class="headerlink" href="#wireless-communications" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Imagine this scenario: you are stranded behind enemy lines, a few
kilometers from the smoking remains of your airplane. From intelligence
briefs received before the mission, you know you’re in a safe area, with
only a very slight chance of capture. Still, you find a reasonably
sheltered spot and pull out your survival radio, hoping to contact a
rescue helicopter.</p>
<p>In order to communicate with the helicopter, you will need to
communicate wirelessly. In your situation, though, how does it work? To
be successful, you will need to understand how wireless communications
work and what factors affect your communication system’s performance.</p>

<section id="radio-frequency-rf-spectrum">
<h3>Radio Frequency (RF) Spectrum<a class="headerlink" href="#radio-frequency-rf-spectrum" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum, called the RF spectrum,
is subdivided into eight bands spanning from 3 kHz to 300 GHz. Each band
has a name, as shown in Figure 1. Civilian applications, such as
commercial AM and FM radio, television, cellular telephony, civilian
aviation navigation, and air traffic control frequencies are found in
this portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. These bands are also used
in many military applications: global positioning system (GPS); RADAR;
munitions guidance and fusing systems; strategic and tactical
communications systems; and intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) systems.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image615.png" /></p>

</section>
<section id="rf-propagation-methods">
<h3>RF Propagation methods<a class="headerlink" href="#rf-propagation-methods" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>There are four different kinds of wireless RF propagation methods. They
are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Direct or line-of-sight (LOS)</p></li>
<li><p>Surface wave</p></li>
<li><p>Sky wave</p></li>
<li><p>Forward scatter</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these pathways involves a propagation path. Since it is possible
for a signal to be transmitted over several paths simultaneously, this
may cause interference. However, some of the pathways only work for
certain bands within the RF spectrum.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Line-of-sight (LOS) Propagation:</strong> All electromagnetic energy (to
include all the RF bands) will propagate by LOS. If you, the
transmitter, are in view of the receiver, then line-of-sight is
established, thus the name. In practice, this means that if nothing
can obstruct the waves traveling directly between the transmitter
and receiver, then line-of-sight propagation can occur. As shown in
Figure 2, LOS communications on the earth are limited by the
curvature of the earth and the heights of transmitting and receiving
antennas. Of course, transmitter power is also a limiting factor.
The signal transmitted from point <em>T</em> reaches the receiving antennas
<em>R­<sub>1­</sub></em> and <em>R­<sub>2­</sub></em>. However, <em>R­<sub>3­</sub></em> is not in the LOS path of the
signal and cannot receive any of the radio’s energy. For
communication and telemetry between earth and space vehicles, LOS
propagation is used. At short distance, secure military
communications commonly occur through LOS microwave links. Some
telephone company “trunks” and cell phone towers also use LOS.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image712.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: Line-of-sight (LOS) propagation between several repeater
stations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Surface Wave Propagation:</strong> In surface wave propagation, the radio
wave travels from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna
along the surface of the earth. This wave essentially diffracts
around the surface of the earth, so you can reach distances greater
than LOS. In this waveguiding process, minute eddy currents are
induced in the ground directly beneath the surface wave. Although
the ground is a fairly good conductor, it does have some resistance
and the energy required for these currents to flow is absorbed from
the wave. This in turn limits how far the wave can effectively
travel.</p>
<p>As frequency increases, losses due to the conductivity of the ground
also increase and greatly attenuate the surface wave. This means
surface waves cannot travel as far at higher frequencies. Surface
waves are very effective for signal propagation in the VLF and LF
bands. However, near the MF band, this effectiveness decreases
rapidly. Surface waves are not generally useful above about 3 MHz.
Commercial AM broadcasting stations typically use surface waves to
transmit their signals - this is one of the main reasons AM radio
signals can travel much further than FM radio signals.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image816.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 3: Surface wave propagation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sky Wave Propagation:</strong> Radio energy reflected or refracted from
the ionosphere back to Earth is known as a sky wave. To understand
how the ionosphere affects radio waves of different frequencies,
think of the ionosphere as a huge mesh sieve surrounding the earth.
Whether or not a wave passes through this sieve depends partially
upon the relative dimensions of the wavelength and of the mesh
openings. Therefore, radio energy with a long wavelength (low
frequency) is more likely to be reflected back to Earth than that
with a short wavelength (high frequency), which will pass through
the mesh. In addition to frequency, the angle of incidence, <em>β</em> in
Figure 4 below, plays a role in determine if the radio energy will
be reflected back to Earth.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image914.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 4: Sky wave propagation.</p>
<p>In general, the larger the angle, <em>β</em>, the greater the probability the
wave will be reflected. However, if <em>β</em> is too large, the layers of
the ionosphere will act like a waveguide and the wave will effectively
remain in the ionosphere and not be returned to Earth. As with the
other wireless RF propagation methods, there is often a tradeoff
between this angle of incidence and frequency. That is, for a given
angle, there is some maximum frequency that can be used for sky wave
propagation. Likewise, for a given frequency (within certain limits),
there is some maximum angle that will produce a sky wave.</p>
<p>Maximum usable frequencies usually lie in the HF band; waves whose
frequencies are above this are refracted slightly by the ionosphere
but propagate through it. A peculiarity of the ionosphere is that its
lower layers readily absorb energy in the MF band. Thus, sky waves in
this band are possible only at night when the lower ionospheric layers
are less dense. Narrowband long haul communications are often
conducted in the HF band via sky wave.</p>
<p>Sky wave propagation has a significant limitation. At the point where
a sky wave returns to Earth, you can detect a very strong signal.
However, between this point and the transmitter, there is essentially
no energy from the sky wave at all. The distance between the
transmitting antenna to the spot where the reflected wave strikes the
earth is called the <em>skip distance</em>. At all locations less than the
skip distance from the transmitting antenna, none of the sky wave
signal is received. Therefore, the only way to communicate at points
less than the skip distance is through LOS or surface wave
communications.</p>
<p>In the HF band, where surface wave propagation is somewhat less than
200 miles, there is often a considerable distance in which essentially
no radiated energy from either the surface wave or the sky wave is
present and no communication is possible. This region is called the
<em>quiet zone</em>. Figure 5 below illustrates the concepts of skip distance
and quiet zone.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image1011.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 5: Skip Distance and Quite Zone.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Forward Scatter Propagation:</strong> When a radiated signal strikes the
discontinuous “blobs” of air in the troposphere, it is scattered in
various directions. Some of this scattering is in the forward
direction, and the resulting radio signal, although relatively weak,
can be received at a point that is beyond the horizon from the
transmitter. Most of the Air Force’s non-satellite wideband long
haul communications use forward scatter (with carriers in the 300 to
400 MHz range).</p>
<p>Although the scatter is dependent upon atmospheric conditions, it is
possible to achieve reliable communications using high-power
transmitters and sensitive receivers. Tropospheric forward scatter is
effective in the VHF, UHF, and SHF bands. These tropo links use large
rectangular “billboard” antennas and typically transmit about 100 kW
of power. Before satellite communication became prevalent, much
in-theater military communication was accomplished using this type of
propagation.</p>

</section>
<section id="range-and-bandwidth-considerations">
<h3>Range and Bandwidth Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#range-and-bandwidth-considerations" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>At higher carrier frequencies, more bandwidth is available for use. As a
rough estimate, the available bandwidth for a signal is about 1% of the
carrier frequency.</p>
<p>AM radio stations, operating around 1 MHz, only have 10 kHz of bandwidth
available. Fiber optics, however, use beams of light with carrier
frequencies on the order of 100 THz (100 trillion cycles per second).
These light beams have available bandwidths up to 1 THz. In other words,
we can transmit approximately 100 Million times more information over a
light beam than we can over a radio signal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission range of signals also depends on the
frequency. AM radio stations can easily transmit signals hundreds of
miles, and as said earlier, these signals can even follow the curvature
of the earth to reach beyond line of sight (surface waves). Light beams,
on the other hand, are quickly attenuated by atmospheric effects. In
order to overcome this limitation while still reaping the benefits of
the huge bandwidth available in beams of light, optical fibers are
generally used. We’ll discuss how frequency affects a signal’s range in
more depth in future lessons.</p>
</section>
<section id="rf-summary">
<h3>RF Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#rf-summary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Let’s quickly summarize which types of wireless communication pathways
are used by different radio frequency bands. This information is
identified below in Figure 7. The ITU (International Telegraphic Union)
designation of frequency bands (e.g., VHF, UHF) and the frequency ranges
for some of the more common uses of radio waves are indicated. Since the
transmitted signal in a communication system usually has a relatively
narrow bandwidth, the propagation characteristics are determined almost
exclusively by the carrier frequency. This figure also summarizes which
radio frequencies are best suited to the four primary pathways that
radio frequency waves propagate through the air and space: direct or
line-of-sight (LOS), surface wave, sky wave, and forward scatter.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image1210.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 7: The RF spectrum and the associated wireless RF propagation
methods.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>VLF and LF (Very Low Frequencies and Low Frequencies):</strong> At these
lower frequencies, surface waves are attenuated very little and may
be used for signal propagation of a thousand miles or more. This
maximum distance gradually decreases with increasing frequency and
is about 400 miles at 300 kHz. The sky wave does exhibit slight
fluctuations with changes in the ionosphere, but it is still fairly
reliable. Sky waves can be used for communication over distances
from about 500 to 8000 miles in the LF band. In the VLF range, the
combination of the surface and sky wave mechanisms make worldwide
signal propagation possible with radiated power levels of about 1
MW.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MF (Medium Frequencies):</strong> In this band, the maximum distance for
surface wave propagation varies from about 400 miles at 300 kHz to
about 200 miles at 3MHz. Ionospheric absorption of electromagnetic
energy in this band (maximum absorption occurs at 1.4 MHz) makes sky
wave propagation impossible during the day. At night, sky waves
furnish reception at distances from about 100 to 3000 miles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>HF (High Frequencies):</strong> The attenuation of surface waves above
about 3 MHz is so great that the surface wave is effectively of no
use for communication in this band. Sky waves are used extensively,
and their behavior is mostly governed by ionospheric conditions.
Although sky wave propagation is not always reliable, it is possible
over distances of 12,000 miles and more. For distances such as this,
frequencies from 5 to 20 MHz have proven most effective. Many
military aircraft have HF radios onboard used for long-range
communication. Also, amateur radio (ham radio) operates primarily in
this part of the spectrum. Amateur radio is primarily used by
hobbyists who are interested in RF communications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>VHF (Very High Frequencies):</strong> Although sky waves may occur at
lower VHF frequencies, their reliability is so poor in the VHF band
that they are virtually useless for communication. The predominant
form of propagation in this band is line-of-sight. The effectiveness
of forward scatter becomes increasingly important as frequencies
reach 50 MHz and above.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>UHF and SHF (Ultra High Frequency and Super High Frequency):</strong>
Line-of-sight propagation is widely used at these frequencies since
excellent low-noise reception is possible. Ranges of a few hundred
miles can be realized up to about 10 GHz. Most forward scatter
applications use frequencies well below this. Many space assets use
this frequency band for communications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>EHF (Extremely High Frequency):</strong> Line-of-sight is the only
propagation method used with EHF. Radio waves at these frequencies
attenuate quickly in many uses, such as RADAR and wireless
communications, so range is limited for these frequencies.
Additionally, the atmosphere absorbs energy from waves, further
attenuating them while in the atmosphere. However, EHF is still
used. Each satellite in the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF)
satellite constellation uses EHF for uplink communications.
Additionally, 5G cellular networks will use frequencies in the lower
portion of the EHF band. Specifically, Verizon has stated that they
use 28 GHz (SHF) and 39 GHz (EHF) for their 5G network.</p></li>

<h2>Line-of-sight Communications<a class="headerlink" href="#line-of-sight-communications" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Returning to our original question, “What kind of wireless RF
propagation method would you use between you and a rescue helicopter?”
Realistically, you’ll most likely find yourself trying to establish a
LOS link. A survival radio does not have the power required to use the
more specialized forms of wireless communications (surface waves, sky
waves, and forward scatter). In LOS, the key to establishing
communications is actually being able to “see” the helicopter and having
enough transmission power.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are a number of variables associated with determining
the LOS between you and the helicopter. Are you on a hill or in a
valley? How high is the hill? Is the terrain flat or bumpy? How high is
the helicopter?</p>
<p>If we assume the terrain is relatively flat, we can use a simple
equation to give us a good idea of how far the helicopter (or anything
else) can see. Consider an antenna sitting at height, <em>h</em>, above sea
level. The maximum range, <em>r</em>, between transmit and receive antennas is
calculated as the distance from the transmit antenna to the point that
is tangential to the surface of the earth as shown in Figure 8.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image138.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 8: Line-of-sight communication range.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{e}\)</span> and <em>r</em> make two sides of a right triangle, with
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{e}\)</span> + <em>h</em>) as the hypotenuse, we can use the Pythagorean theorem
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}\)</span>) to find:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[R_{e}^{2} + r^{2} = \left( R_{e} + h \right)^{2}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[{(R_{e} + h)}^{2} = R_{e}^{2} + 2R_{e}h + h^{2}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[R_{e}^{2} + r^{2} = R_{e}^{2} + 2R_{e}h + h^{2}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[r^{2} = R_{e}^{2} + 2R_{e}h + h^{2} - R_{e}^{2}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[r^{2} = 2R_{e}h + h^{2}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[r = \sqrt{2R_{e}h + h^{2}}\]</div>
<p>For terrestrial and even some airborne applications (i.e., non-space),
we can assume that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{e}\)</span> is much greater than the antenna height
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{e} \gg h)\)</span>, so the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h^{2}\)</span> can safely be ignored. This results in a
maximum LOS range equation of:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[r_{\max} = \ \sqrt{2R_{e}h}\]</div>
<p>Furthermore, the radius of the Earth is adjusted to account for
atmospheric effects (decreasing atmospheric pressure helps bend radio
waves downward thus increasing range). The resultant radius is increased
from 3960 miles to 5280 miles, using the common 4/3 radius model.
Coincidentally, there are 5280 feet in a mile. As a result, we can
employ a “mixed units” equation, entering the antenna height (<em>h</em>) in
feet to find the range in miles. This makes our LOS equation:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[r = \ \sqrt{2h}\]</div>
<p>In this equation, <em>h</em> is the height (<em><strong>in feet</strong></em>) of the observer, and
<em>r</em> is the distance (<em><strong>in miles</strong></em>) the observer can see before the
horizon gets in the way. Notice this is an “improper” equation, which is
to say the units don’t match - if we take the square root of feet, we
should not end up with miles. As engineers, we’re willing to overlook
this discrepancy and use this improper equation because it is useful,
and its derivation produces a mathematically logical result.</p>

tall hill, how far away could the helicopter establish line-of-sight?</p>
<p><strong>Understand</strong>: We have to use the LOS equation twice because the airman
has raised himself above the surface, as shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/image156.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Identify Key Information</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Knowns:</strong> We know the height of both the helicopter and the
stranded airman.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unknowns:</strong> The maximum LOS distance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> The terrain is flat and no mountains are in the
way.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plan:</strong> Recall, we are trying to determine the <em>maximum</em> distance the
helicopter can see the airman. As the picture above hopefully shows,
this occurs when the airman climbs high enough to just barely be in the
helicopter’s line-of-sight. At this point, the helicopter will see the
airman on the horizon, not even knowing the airman is standing on a hill
(since the hill is below the helicopter’s horizon). From the point of
view of the airman, the helicopter will also appear right at the
horizon. Calculating this maximum LOS distance is very straightforward.
We first figure out how far the horizon is from the helicopter, and
then, we figure out how far the horizon is from the airman. If we add
these two distances, we get the maximum distance they can see each
other.</p>
<p><strong>Solve</strong>: We already calculated the distance from the helicopter to the
horizon in the previous problem. It is 63.25 miles. Since the airman is
on a 50-foot hill, the distance for him to the horizon is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[r = \ \sqrt{2h} = \ \sqrt{2*50} = \ \sqrt{100} = 10\ miles\]</div>
<p>Adding these distances together gives us our answer:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[r_{total} = 63.25\ miles + 10\ miles\  = 73.25\ miles\]</div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The airman and the helicopter now have a maximum LOS
distance of 73.25 miles, which is 10 miles farther than before.</p>
