# Practice Problems

Here you will find the practice problems used for both ECE215 and ECE215S. These files are homeworks from prior semesters _and will not be graded_. These are meant as a resource to prepare for quizzes. You will find two files for each set of problems - one blank PDF and one with the answers only so that you can check your work. 

As you work through these, please ask questions. Seek EI early and often!
