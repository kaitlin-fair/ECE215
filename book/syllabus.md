# Syllabus

Your syllabus contains course requirements, grading breakdown, grading mechanics _(recommend you read through this thoroughly)_, and general course policies. Again note that ECE215 and ECE215S share the same title, Principles of Electronic Cyber Warfare, and cover the same foundational concepts. These syllabi are therefore very similar.   

For information on your schedule or topics covered, please see those respective pages on this course website.
