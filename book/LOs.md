# Course Learning Objectives

This course will focus on specific learning objectives, which are key concepts required to succeed in this course and retain knowledge for future academic and professional endeavors. Your mastery (i.e. understanding) of each learning objective will be assessed with quizzes, projects, and examinations (midterm and final).

You will see each of these learning objectives referenced across course material by the number you see on this list. The objectives are listed in the order in which they will be covered. Specifically, you will see these learning objectives in your syllabus, reading materials, slides, quizzes, and exams. 

Note that the number to the left of the decimal for your learning objective is the block number within which the objective resides. The number to the right of the decimal is the objective number within that block, in the order content will be covered.
